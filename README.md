Habitown Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. It is Habitown’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our app, Habitown, and other services we operate.

1. Data Collection and Authentication
We use only Google Authentication for user access at this time. We do not store any confidential personal data on our servers. Authentication is handled entirely through Google services, meaning your personal information (such as your password) is managed by Google. We do not have access to your Google credentials or store any of your personal data except your email as a username.

2. Data Usage and Retention
As we do not store any personal data, no user information is retained on Habitown's servers. Any data processed during authentication is handled directly by Google and follows their privacy and security policies.

3. Data Sharing
Since we do not store any personally identifiable information, we do not share your personal data with any third parties, except when required by law.

4. Data Controller and Processor
Habitown acts as a data controller only in terms of authentication data received from Google. However, Google services manage the actual processing of authentication, in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

5. External Links
Our app may contain links to external sites not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content or privacy practices of these third-party sites and cannot accept responsibility for their privacy policies.

6. User Rights
You are free to refuse Google’s request for personal information, with the understanding that this may prevent access to the services provided by Habitown.

7. Consent
Your continued use of the Habitown app signifies your acceptance of our practices regarding privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, please contact us.

Effective Date
This policy is effective as of 29 September 2024.
